## <a name="overview"/> Overview
### Description
The IoT Agent Manager works as a proxy for scenarios where multiple IoT Agents offer different southbound protocols.
The IoTA Manager appears as a single administration endpoint for provisioning tasks, redirecting provisioning requests
to the appropriate IoTAgent based on the declared protocol.

The IoTAgent Manager also offers a cache of all the provided device Configurations, to fasten the retrieval of certain
information from the Agents.

Additional information about operating the component can be found in the [Operations: logs and alarms](docs/operations.md) document.

## <a name="configuration"/> Configuration
The IoT Agent Manager main configuration point is the `config.js` file at the root of the project. The following section
explains each configuration parameter in detail.

### Configuration parameters
* **server.port**: port where the server will be listening for connections.
* **server.host**: address the server will bind to.
* **mongodb.host**: host where the Mongo DB instance is listening.
* **mongodb.port**: port where the Mongo DB instance is listening.
* **mongodb.db**: name of the Mongo DB database to use.
* **logLevel**: set the log level for the internal logger. Its allowed values are: FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.

### Environment variables
Some of the configuration parameters can also be modified using environment variables when starting the process. The
following table shows the correspondence between allowed environment variables and configuration parameters.

| Environment variable      | Configuration attribute             |
|:------------------------- |:----------------------------------- |
| IOTA_SERVER_PORT          | server.port                         |
| IOTA_SERVER_HOST          | server.host                         |
| IOTA_MONGO_HOST           | mongodb.host                        |
| IOTA_MONGO_PORT           | mongodb.port                        |
| IOTA_MONGO_REPLICASET     | mongodb.replicaSet                  |
| IOTA_MONGO_DB             | mongodb.db                          |
| IOTA_LOG_LEVEL            | logLevel                            |

## <a name="installation"/> Installation
There are two ways of installing the IoT Agent Manager: using Git or RPMs.

### Using GIT
In order to install the IoT Agent Manager, just clone the project and install the dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-manager.git
npm install
```
In order to start the IoT Agent Manager, from the root folder of the project, type:
```
bin/iota-manager
```

### Using RPM
The project contains a script for generating an RPM that can be installed in Red Hat 6.5 compatible Linux distributions.
The RPM depends on Node.js 0.10 version, so EPEL repositories are advisable.

In order to create the RPM, execute the following scritp, inside the `/rpm` folder:
```
create-rpm.sh -v <versionNumber> -r <releaseNumber>
```

Once the RPM is generated, it can be installed using the followogin command:
```
yum localinstall --nogpg <nameOfTheRPM>.rpm
```

The IoTA Manager will then be installed as a linux service, and can ve started with the `service` command as usual:
```
service iotamanager start
```

### Docker installation
The Docker automatically starts listening in the API ports, so there is no need to execute any process in order to
have the application running. The Docker image will automatically start.

In order to run the docker image, first you must have a MongoDB instance running. You can achieve this by executing
the followin command:
```
docker run --name mongodb -d mongo
```

### Build your own Docker image
There is also the possibility to build your own local Docker image of the IOTagent-manager component.

To do it, follow the next steps once you have installed Docker in your machine:

1. Navigate to the path where the component repository was cloned.
2. Launch a Docker build
    * Using the default NodeJS version of the operating system used defined in FROM keyword of Dockerfile:
    ```bash
    sudo docker build -f Dockerfile .
    ```
    * Using an alternative NodeJS version:
    ```bash
    sudo docker build --build-arg NODEJS_VERSION=0.10.46 -f Dockerfile .
    ```

Once the MongoDB instance is running, you can execute the IoT Manager with the following command:
```
docker run -d  --link mongodb:mongo -e "IOTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG" -e "IOTA_MONGO_HOST=mongo" -p 8082:8082 telefonicaiot/iotamanager
```

### Using PM2

The IoT Agent Manager within the Docker image can be run encapsulated within the [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) Process
Manager by adding the `PM2_ENABLED` environment variable.

```console
docker run --name iotagent-manager -e PM2_ENABLED=true -d fiware/iotagent-manager
```

Use of pm2 is **disabled** by default. It is unnecessary and counterproductive to add an additional process manager if
your dockerized environment is already configured to restart Node.js processes whenever they exit (e.g. when using
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/))


## <a name="usage"/> Usage
In order to execute the IoT Agent Manager just execute the following command from the root folder:
```
bin/iota-manager.js
```
This will start the IoT Agent Manager in the foreground. Use standard linux commands to start it in background.

When started with no arguments, the IoT Agent Manager will expect to find a `config.js` file with the configuration in
the root folder. An argument can be passed with the path to a new configuration file (relative to the application folder)
to be used instead of the default one.

## <a name="subscriptionapi"/> Subscription API

#### New Subscription (POST /iot/protocols)
Whenever a new IoT Agent wants to register itself into the IoTAgent Manager, it must send a subscription request to
the following path: ``, indicating the following information:
* *protocol*: Name of the protocol served by the IoTAgent.
* *description*: Textual description for its display in portals.
* *iotagent*: URL address where requests for this IoT Agent will be redirected.
* *resource*: Unique string used to identify different IoT Agents for the same protocol.
* *services*: List of device Configurations available in the IoT Agent. The IoTA Manager saves a cache for all the
configurations, aimed to be used to fasten the operations agains the IoTA databases.

The following example shows a registration of an IoT Agent that already have some configuration groups registered in the
IoT Agent:
```
{
  "protocol": "GENERIC_PROTOCOL",
  "description": "A generic protocol",
  "iotagent": "http://smartGondor.com/iot",
  "resource": "/iot/d",
  "services": [
    {
      "apikey": "801230BJKL23Y9090DSFL123HJK09H324HV8732",
      "token": "8970A9078A803H3BL98PINEQRW8342HBAMS",
      "entity_type": "SensorMachine",
      "resource": "/deviceTest",
      "service": "theService",
      "service_path": "theSubService",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "status",
          "type": "Boolean"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This operation can be used also to update the protocol subscriptions. If a protocol creation request arrives to the
IoTAgent Manager with the same protocol and resource of an already existing agent, it will override the record with the
new information.

#### List subscriptions (GET /iot/protocols)
Retrieve the list of all the available protocols, with their available endpoints. The following example shows a sample
response from the server:
```
{
   "count": 1,
   "protocols": [
     {
       "protocol" : "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
       "description" : "UL2",
       "endpoints" : [
          { "endpoint" : "http://127.0.0.1:8080/iot",
            "identifier" : "idcl1:8080",
            "resource" : "/iot/d"
          }
        ]
     }
    ]
 }
```

The list accepts to query parameters:
* *limit*: limits the number of entries to return from the query.
* *offset*: skips the given number of entries from the database before returning the list.
